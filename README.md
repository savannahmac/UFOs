# UFOs

## Project Overview 
The goal of this project was to create an HTML webpage that would house an article on UFOs alongside data regarding UFO sightings around the world. 
The article presents readers with an opportunity to dig through this data in order to determine whether or not they believe aliens exist and whether or not they would like contact with Earth.
In order to participate in this data-digging opportunity, guests to the website will need to be able to filter the data by:
- Date
- City
- State 
- Country
- Shape.
The final product should give users the chance to read the article, then interact with the data. It should also appear professional and visually pleasing.

## Results
When users access the website, they will encounter the header and article at the top of the page. The page has been created based on the storyboard provided. 
This layout encourages users to read the article before diving in to the data.

Below the article, users will encounter a prefilled table of all of the UFO sighting data. Users can scroll through this data to see the overwhelming number
of sightings contained within the table.

To the left of the data, users will see the five filters. Users can type the name of any city or state, a country code (ex: us), a specific date, or a common UFO shape into the white text boxes. 
When the user types in their desired filter and presses the "Enter" key, the table will automatically filter and present only the desired data. For example, in the image below, I filtered for sightings in Naples, FL:

![naples search](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93888037/158091329-eea30bbe-a3ac-4908-92d1-6216b5c9dfd2.png)

As an additional example, here is the table when I search for a common UFO shape, "fireball".

When users clear their filter, the page returns to the original table. 

## Summary
One drawback to this design is that users would have to know specific cities, dates, or UFO shapes in order to effectively use the tool. As a developer, I
knew to search for things like "naples," and "fireball," because I have access to the data. However, users who are not "in the know" might have a difficult time
determining what to type in the filter boxes. 

In further versions of this site, I would recommend: 
- Dropdown menus for each filter category.
	- Dropdown menus would be more effective than user input because it allows users who are unfamiliar with UFO sightings to fully participate in the data dig.
- Additional data collection in order to provide more visual elements.
	- Once users have filtered the data, they may be eager to learn more about the UFO sightings they've uncovered! Continued data collection could provide users with an opportunity to see pictures or news articles about some of the more noteworthy sightings contained in the data. 
	- A "Gallery" or "Additional Resources" tab on the webpage could allow users an opportunity to browse images, website links, and more.
	- Eventually, this could be added as an element on the table. For example, if there are photos or news articles about the "Benton, AR" sighting, a link to the additional resources tab would appear and it would take you directly to that information. 
	- More interactivity could catch the attention of users who are just beginning to explore UFOs.
